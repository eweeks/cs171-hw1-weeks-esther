Intro Questions - Esther Weeks

1. Summary statistics could be displayed more effectively by:
	- allowing sorting of data by viewer with button or other action. Sorting options
 		could include min, max, name, and rank.
 	- Highlighting the min and max. This could be done with color, shading or a
 		mark/symbol next to the name. 
 	- Adding a shape or bar comparison to give a visual impression of the relationships
 		between the numbers. 

2. Examples:
	1. http://labs.enigma.io/shutdown2013/
		-Similar to the example we looked at in class week 2, but an interactive 
		comparison. 

	2. http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/05/13/business/student-debt-at-colleges-and-universities.html
		-Interactive way to explore this data. Many ways for viewer to explore this data.

		-Family Spending in the 20th Century; I felt did a good job of taking complex data
		and keeping it simple and readable. The bottom scale is a bit distracting but
		overall it is effective.

		- Not all that great visually, but the changeable scaling options are 
		interesting. It successfully makes the authors point about how close these races 
		are and gives the viewer a frame of reference to relate to.
