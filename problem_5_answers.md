Problem 4 Questions - Esther Weeks

1. Title, labels etc. There is nothing to tell you what you are looking at, or what the
	bars represent. It's not usable as is. 

2. The g elements create a nested structure, this makes positioning and selecting parts
	of the table easier. The first g holds all elements of the table, title, heading,
	bars, etc. the second g holds all of the bars in one group. The last g holds individual
	bars, with elements specific to them, such as rect and text. 
	
3. Yes, the order does matter here. That is also the order they will be added to the page,
	if you add the text first, the rect will be above the text and you will not see the text.
